# Smart Doors
Makes doors smarter. Allows doors to synchronize across multiple scenes and sends chat messages when players try to open locked doors (and also tells you which of the doors).

## Planned features
- Attach macros to doors that are being executed when the door is being opened/closed
- Give out keys to players, that allow them to lock/unlock associated doors
